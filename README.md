# DataQuest Project 13 Mobile App to Combat Lottery Addiction

This is the thirteenth project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. The goal of this project was to use probability theory to construct the logical core of an app, that tells users their chances of winning in the lottery given certain conditions.

The educational goal of the project was to gain a better understanding of probability theory by applying it to different problems.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the Jupyter notebook as well as the `CSV` file containing all of the past draws in the Canadian lottery.

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy` and `Pandas`, ` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
