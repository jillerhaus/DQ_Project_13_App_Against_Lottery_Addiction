    "In this project the logical core to an app meant to dissuade lottery addicts from buying lottery tickets will be constructed by showing the probability of winning in different circumstances.\n",

    "The goal of the project will be to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the lottery with a single ticket?\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning with a number of tickets?\n",
    "* What is the probability of having at least a certain number of winning numbers in a single ticket?\n",

This is helped by many people not having a clear understanding of how probability works. Having access to clear odds might dissuade some addicts from tricking themselves into believing their odds are higher than they actually are."
